TicTacToe using Arrays
=========

This program, written in C++ allows two people to play TicTacToe through the use of arrays. I created this program as my final lab in my computer science I course. I created a multi-dimensional array to represent the board with three columns and three rows. I wrote functions to make a move, display the board, and check to see if there is a winner.
